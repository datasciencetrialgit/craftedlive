      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>To connect global artisans directly with conscious customers, enabling collaborative jewelry creation rooted in transparency, ethical sourcing, and cultural authenticity. We believe jewelry is not just an accessory, but a story—crafted by skilled hands, shaped by culture, and driven by purpose. 
      <br><br>
      Crafted Live exists to protect and promote this legacy by supporting artisans and connecting them to meaningful markets. While we celebrate the heritage of handcrafted jewelry, we also embrace modern techniques—ensuring that even contemporary designs receive the final artistic touch from skilled hands. Our initial focus is on colored gemstone jewelry, combining tradition, elegance, and originality.
      <br><br>
      We honor the full journey of a gem—from the miner who unearths it, to the faceter who reveals its brilliance, and finally to the artisan who gives it a soul through design. Each piece we support is a collaboration across this chain, highlighting the beauty of cooperation and craftsmanship.</p>
